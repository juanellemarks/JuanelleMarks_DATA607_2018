###AssignmentQuestion
Choose six recent popular movies. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movie that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database. Load the information into an R dataframe.
Your deliverables should include your SQL scripts and your R Markdown code, posted to GitHub.
